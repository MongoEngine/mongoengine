.. versionadded:: 0.5

.. note::

  Signal support is provided by the excellent `blinker`_ library. If you wish
  to enable signal support this library must be installed, though it is not
  required for MongoEngine to function.

Overview
--------

Signals are found within the `mongoengine.signals` module.  Unless
specified signals receive no additional arguments beyond the `sender` class and
`document` instance.  Post-signals are only called if there were no exceptions
raised during the processing of their related function.

Available signals include:

`pre_init`
  Called during the creation of a new :class:`~mongoengine.Document` or
  :class:`~mongoengine.EmbeddedDocument` instance, after the constructor
  arguments have been collected but before any additional processing has been
  done to them.  (I.e. assignment of default values.)  Handlers for this signal
  are passed the dictionary of arguments using the `values` keyword argument
  and may modify this dictionary prior to returning.

`post_init`
  Called after all processing of a new :class:`~mongoengine.Document` or
  :class:`~mongoengine.EmbeddedDocument` instance has been completed.

`pre_save`
  Called within :meth:`~mongoengine.document.Document.save` prior to performing
  any actions.

`pre_save_post_validation`
  Called within :meth:`~mongoengine.document.Document.save` after validation
  has taken place but before saving.

`post_save`
  Called within :meth:`~mongoengine.document.Document.save` after all actions
  (validation, insert/update, cascades, clearing dirty flags) have completed
  successfully.  Passed the additional boolean keyword argument `created` to
  indicate if the save was an insert or an update.

`pre_delete`
  Called within :meth:`~mongoengine.document.Document.delete` prior to
  attempting the delete operation.

`post_delete`
  Called within :meth:`~mongoengine.document.Document.delete` upon successful
  deletion of the record.

`pre_bulk_insert`
  Called after validation of the documents to insert, but prior to any data
  being written. In this case, the `document` argument is replaced by a
  `documents` argument representing the list of documents being inserted.

`post_bulk_insert`
  Called after a successful bulk insert operation.  As per `pre_bulk_insert`,
  the `document` argument is omitted and replaced with a `documents` argument.
  An additional boolean argument, `loaded`, identifies the contents of
  `documents` as either :class:`~mongoengine.Document` instances when `True` or
  simply a list of primary key values for the inserted records if `False`.

Attaching Events
----------------

After writing a handler function like the following::

    import logging
    from datetime import datetime

    from mongoengine import *
    from mongoengine import signals

    def update_modified(sender, document):
        document.modified = datetime.utcnow()

You attach the event handler to your :class:`~mongoengine.Document` or
:class:`~mongoengine.EmbeddedDocument` subclass::

    class Record(Document):
        modified = DateTimeField()

    signals.pre_save.connect(update_modified)

While this is not the most elaborate document model, it does demonstrate the
concepts involved.  As a more complete demonstration you can also define your
handlers within your subclass::

    class Author(Document):
        name = StringField()

        @classmethod
        def pre_save(cls, sender, document, **kwargs):
            logging.debug("Pre Save: %s" % document.name)

        @classmethod
        def post_save(cls, sender, document, **kwargs):
            logging.debug("Post Save: %s" % document.name)
            if 'created' in kwargs:
                if kwargs['created']:
                    logging.debug("Created")
                else:
                    logging.debug("Updated")

    signals.pre_save.connect(Author.pre_save, sender=Author)
    signals.post_save.connect(Author.post_save, sender=Author)

Finally, you can also use this small decorator to quickly create a number of
signals and attach them to your :class:`~mongoengine.Document` or
:class:`~mongoengine.EmbeddedDocument` subclasses as class decorators::

    def handler(event):
        """Signal decorator to allow use of callback functions as class decorators."""

        def decorator(fn):
            def apply(cls):
                event.connect(fn, sender=cls)
                return cls

            fn.apply = apply
            return fn

        return decorator

Using the first example of updating a modification time the code is now much
cleaner looking while still allowing manual execution of the callback::

    @handler(signals.pre_save)
    def update_modified(sender, document):
        document.modified = datetime.utcnow()

    @update_modified.apply
    class Record(Document):
        modified = DateTimeField()


ReferenceFields and Signals
---------------------------

Currently `reverse_delete_rules` do not trigger signals on the other part of
the relationship.  If this is required you must manually handle the
reverse deletion.
