Does MongoEngine support asynchronous drivers (Motor, TxMongo)?
---------------------------------------------------------------

No, MongoEngine is exclusively based on PyMongo and isn't designed to support other driver.
If this is a requirement for your project, check the alternative:  `uMongo`_ and `MotorEngine`_.
