# For full coverage, we'd have to test all supported Python, MongoDB, and
# PyMongo combinations. However, that would result in an overly long build
# with a very large number of jobs, hence we only test a subset of all the
# combinations:
# * MongoDB v2.4 & v3.0 are only tested against Python v2.7 & v3.5.
# * MongoDB v2.4 is tested against PyMongo v2.7 & v3.x.
# * MongoDB v3.0 is tested against PyMongo v3.x.
# * MongoDB v2.6 is currently the "main" version tested against Python v2.7,
#   v3.5, PyPy & PyPy3, and PyMongo v2.7, v2.8 & v3.x.
#
# Reminder: Update README.rst if you change MongoDB versions we test.
